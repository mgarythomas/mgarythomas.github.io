# Overview

TOGAF defines levels of architecture within an Architecture Landscape:
- Strategic
- Segment
- Capability

For simplicity, Business capabilities can exist at different levels as well. Even when we are dealing with architecture at a Strategic level we would expect that to encompass business capabilities at a broader level.

# Methodology

While TOGAF has a phased view and iterations, for simplicity I have broken down the steps of the approach to align to simpler terms.

The idea being to show a simple flow from left to right of the different phases and artifacts. Note that within each phase there are iterations and it is possible to work on items in parallel.

*Note that key TOGAF terms are shown in red, these are a mix of phases and artifacts.*
