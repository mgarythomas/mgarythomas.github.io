# Overview

The maturity of an architecture is a key aspect of Enterprise Architecture based on the critical domains and capabilities that are required for an Enterprise Architecture Practice.

# Maturity Model


| Domains | 1<br>Initial | 2<br>Under Development | 3<br>Defined | 4<br>Managed | 5<br>Measured |
|---------|--------------|------------------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| **1- Architecture Organisational Structure** | No structured EA documentation or standards. | Incomplete formalisation of a framework. | EA business & IT models, and capability-based roadmaps exist. | EA is regularly updated, and an iterative methodology is used. | EA drives continuous improvement and innovation using data-driven capability insights. |
| **2- Business Strategy Alignment** | No relationship between EA and business strategy. | Some explicit relationship between EA and the business. | EA is actively involved in developing and communicating business strategy. | EA has a process to disseminate strategies throughout their firm. | Capability's measured outcomes are derived from strategy. |
| **3- Business Capabilities** | No formal capability map. | Basic capabilities exist but are not validated by business. | Business capabilities are well-communicated and aligned with strategic objectives. | Capabilities aligned with stakeholders, applications, information, and processes. | KPIs are tracked for important business capabilities. |
| **4- Senior Management Participation** | Minimal understanding of EA among senior leadership. | Some senior leaders acknowledge EA's value but do not actively participate. | Management provides direction and sponsorship for EA efforts. | Senior management uses EA to drive strategic decisions. | Financial metrics, like ROI, used to measure the performance of EA. |
| **5- Business Unit Participation** | Business units are unaware of EA activities. | At least one business unit contributes to EA activities. | Most business units collaborate with EA teams. | EA is included in the planning process of the organisation. | Financial metrics, like ROI, used to measure the performance of EA. |
| **6- Architecture Communication** | No organised communication about EA. | Some internal communication occurs but with no consistency. | Regular communication about EA is implemented. | EA communication is a structured and continuous process. | Engagement metrics are in place to measure EA communication. |
| **7- Security** | Security considerations are reactive. | Pro-active security is recognised but not consistently applied. | Business and IT security is integrated into EA. | A managed and formal security architecture exists. | Risk reduction metrics and threat incident readiness measures exist. |
| **8- Strategic Initiative Planning** | Almost no strategic alignment of IT investments. | IT investment decisions are sometimes based on strategies. | IT investments align with business strategies. | IT spending managed using business outcomes tied to strategies. | Project outcomes measured and decisions continuously optimised. |
| **9- Solution Delivery Execution** | EA not involved in solution delivery and execution. | EA sometimes involved in the solution delivery and execution. | EA is involved in the solution delivery and execution. | Projects and requirements based on capability-based roadmaps. | EA involvement in the solution delivery and execution measured. |
| **10- Governance and Compliance** | No governance of architecture activities. | Some governance frameworks exist but are not enforced. | EA governance is structured and implemented. | EA Governance is actively used for business decision-making. | EA Governance is measured and optimised for effectiveness. |
| **11- EA Tool Support** | No dedicated EA tools in use. | Basic documentation tools used inconsistently. | Standardised EA tool implemented across organisation. | Integrated EA toolset with repositories and modelling capabilities. | Advanced analytics and reporting from EA tools drive decision-making. |
| **12- EA Capability & Resourcing** | No dedicated EA resources or skills. | Limited EA skills with part-time resources. | Dedicated EA team with defined roles and responsibilities. | EA skills formally developed with training and certification programmes. | Centre of Excellence established with specialised EA expertise. |
| **13- Integration with Other Frameworks** | No integration with other management frameworks. | Limited awareness of potential framework integration. | Formal integration with some management frameworks (ITIL, Agile, etc.). | Comprehensive integration across multiple frameworks with clear touchpoints. | Measured synergies across integrated frameworks demonstrating enhanced value. |
| **14- EA Value Realisation** | No measured value from EA activities. | Anecdotal evidence of EA benefits. | Qualitative benefits of EA documented and communicated. | Formal EA value metrics established and regularly reported. | Quantifiable EA ROI demonstrated with continuous value optimisation. |
