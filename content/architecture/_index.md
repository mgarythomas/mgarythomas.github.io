# Architecture

## What is architecture?

I am not sure, I have heard so many subjective definitions. 

The most consistent elements of the definition relate to it being a shared understanding of a system or systems and their components. This means that features of an architecture would also include:
- The structure of the various components including the infrastructure they require
- The relationships between the components how they integrate and the means of interaction and communication
- The standards, principles and guidelines governing the design and evolution of the system
- How it meets the requirements of resilience, scalability, performance, security, etc. I don't like referring to these as non-functional requirements as they are very much a requirement of the architecture and a desired outcome of the architecture.

## Why do we have architecture?
It is to communicate to all the stakeholders what the system is, how it works, and how it is expected to perform. It is also an alignment between the Business Strategy and Requirements and the Technology Architecture that is to realise that strategy and requirement.

What I have found through many different architecture assignments is that architects seem to define the views of their architecture for the benefit of other architects - I am looking at you Archimate!
Yet, if we are harmonising the business strategy with the technology strategy and architecture *our Stakeholders are both business and technology*. We must present views that are understandable by both, though not necessarily in a single view.

I am not arguing against the use of views, this is a necessity to provide the levels of detail required by the different stakeholders, but repeatedly I see architects focus on the concerns of the business **OR**  the concerns of the technology and are not good at harmonising both.
