# TOGAF Architecture Framework

This doesn't represent my personal view of architecture, but the TOGAF Standard, and is a summary of the notes I made while studying and prior to sitting the TOGAF certification exam.

## Definition of Architecture
 The TOGAF Standard enhances the ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 terminology
1. The fundamental concepts or properties of a
system in its environment embodied in its elements,
relationships and in the principles of its design &
evolution.
(Source: ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010: 2011)
2. The structure of components, their
interrelationships & the principles and guidelines
governing their design & evolution over time.
