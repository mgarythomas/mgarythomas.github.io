# Architecture Levels

If the scope refers to the breadth, depth and time dimensions what are the defined levels of an architecture?

The TOGAF standard defines 3 levels of architecture:

- *Strategic Architecture* - Supports direction setting at an executive level
- *Segment Architecture* - Supports direction setting and the development of architecture roadmaps to programme of portfolio level
- *Capability Architecture* - Supports the development of effective architecture roadmaps realising capability increments
