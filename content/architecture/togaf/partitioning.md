# Architecture Partitioning

## Overview

The TOGAF standard provides a framework for partitioning an architecture into different components.

## Approach
A divided subset of an Architecture facilitates its development and management. A specific form of abstraction.

1. Defined boundaries, governance and ownership
 - This may lead to serveral architecture partions
2. One owning team
 - Architecture are partitioned such that there is a single team owning the Architecture
3. Multiple Architecture Partitions
 - A single team may own multiple partitions, *but* a single Architecture cannot be owned by multiple teams.
 - The team will execute the ADM to define, govern and realise the Architecture.
4. Adopt a partitioning model that reflects the Enterprise Operating Model.

## Benefits

The theory is that partitioning will simplify the development and management of Architectures - Note if this is not the case the review the approach and alignment to the Enterprise Operating Model.

- *Conflict Management* - Clear partitions along Organisational boundaries may avoid conflicts and disputes.
- *Re-Use* - Effective Architecture should encourage modularisation and re-use of components that can be incorporated into other Architectures.
- *Parallelisation* - Enables specific groups of Architects to own and develop elements of Architectures in at the same time (in parallel)
- *Manage Complexity* - Divides an Architecture into subsets to reduce complexity, ensure effective governance and simplify the development & management.
