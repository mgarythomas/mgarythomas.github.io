# Enterprise Continuum

![Enterprise Continuum](/images/architecture/togaf/enterpriseContinuum.png)

Provides structure and categorisation of assets held within the Enterprise Repositories.
- Sets a broader context to the re-use of the artifacts
- Explains how generic solutions can be leveraged and specialised so that they can be re-used to support the architecture requirements of an individual organisation
- Comprises of 2 distinct continuums - Architecture and Solution
- Provides a view or perspective of the models, patterns, viewpoints, building blocks and other artifacts stored in the repository
- This includes Internal architecture and solution artifacts that have been delivered from previous work and are available for re-use.
- It may also extend to include external architecture and solution artifacts taken from industry reference models or patterns (e.g. AWS Reference Architecture and Well-Architected framework)
