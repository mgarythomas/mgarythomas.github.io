An Enterprise Architecture may describe multiple different states:

# 1. Baseline Architecture (As-Is)
- Represents the current state of the architecture.
- Documents existing systems, technologies, and business processes.

# 2. Target Architecture (To-Be)
- Defines the desired future state.
- Aligns with business and IT strategy.

# 3. Transition Architectures
- Intermediate steps between As-Is and To-Be states.
- Used for phased implementation to manage complexity.

# 4. Resting Architecture (steady state)
- Major design effort are completed and the organisation is an operational and governance phase
- In iterations, this may precede another iteration of the architecture (phases)
- Value may be delivered to the organisation from this state

# 5. Candidate Architecture
- A future (Target) state of the architecture that has not been approved by Stakeholders

# Architecture Roadmap
- Defines the plan to move from Baseline to Target.
- Includes timelines, dependencies, and implementation priorities.
