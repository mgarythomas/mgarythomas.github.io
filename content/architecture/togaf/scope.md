# Architecture Scope

## Dimensions

4 dimensions define the limit and the scope of an architecture:

| *Enterprise* | *Detail* | *Domain* | *Period* |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------|
| Breadth | Depth | BDAT | Planning Horizon |
| - What is the full extent of the enterprise? | - What level of detail will the architecture cover? | - What domains will the architecture cover? | - What time period for the architecture vision? |
| - How much will the architecture cover? | - How much architecture is enough? | - Business | - Can we cover the period to a required level of detail? |
| - Organisations | - What is the boundary between solution and delivery? | - Data | - Do we have enough information? |
| - Business Units | | - Application | - Do we have enough resources to complete the architecture? |
