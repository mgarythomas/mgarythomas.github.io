## TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM)

TOGAF uses a "crop circle" diagram to show the progress of the different phases of the ADM.

Prior to commencing the ADM, the Preliminary phase should be completed, which will provide the framework and principles for the ADM. The phases may occur in parallel.

The circle theme is used to show the possible iterations of the architecture over time.

Requirements are in the centre as they will be updated and managed throughout the ADM phases.

The TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM) consists of several phases:

| Phase | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| P | Preliminary | Framework and principles - Prepare the organization for successful architecture projects |
| A | Architecture Vision | Set the scope, constraints, and expectations for a project |
| B | Business Architecture | Develop baseline and target business architectures |
| C | Information Systems Architecture | Develop baseline and target data and application architectures |
| D | Technology Architecture | Develop baseline and target technology architectures |
| E | Opportunities and Solutions | Initial implementation planning and identification of delivery vehicles |
| F | Migration Planning | Detailed implementation and migration plan |
| G | Implementation Governance | Provide architectural oversight for implementation |
| H | Architecture Change Management | Monitor and manage architectural changes |
| R | Requirements Management | Manage architecture requirements throughout the ADM |
