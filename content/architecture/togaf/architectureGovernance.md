# Governance

![Architecture Governance](/images/architecture/togaf/architectureGovernance.png)

## Overview

Within TOGAF the focus is on Architecture Governance and how it supports other forms of governance within an enterprise.

## Definition

Given the focus on architecture governance within TOGAF, we can define governance as the system by which the current and future state are directed and controlled.
- A committed and hierarchical decision-making process with a defined structure of relationships to direct and control the enterprise to achieve stated goals.
- Enables the equality of concerns and transparency (making sure all Stakeholders concerns are reflected), protecting the rights and interests of the business.
- It can be used to drive a set of behaviours controlled via measurements and metrics.

### Customisation

A customised governance approach should define - How, When, Why and What?

|What|Why|How|
|---|---|---|
| - Development of the Target Architecture |- Without governance there is no need to develop a target architecture| - Architects & Implementer are directed & controlled by Stakeholders |
| - All changes within the scope of the Target Architecture |- Direct & Control change| - Architecture Project (Statement of Architecture Work, Target Architecture Checklist)|
| | | - Implementation Projects: Architecture Contracts, Architecture Requirements Specifications|


## Corporate Governance

A system by which business corporations are directed and controlled.
- Ensures that the business is conducted properly through the guidance and usage of resources
- Focuses on the rights, roles and equitable treatment of Shareholders.
- Enacts a board to review and guide corporate startegy and to set and monitor the achievement of performance objectives.
- Ensures disclosure and transparency of the responsibilities of the board.
- Ensures that strategic guidance, monitoring of management and board accountability are in place. 

## Architecture Governance

A system by which enterprise architectures are directed and controlled.
- This is a practice and orientation by which Enterprise Architecture and other architectures are managed and controlled at an enterprise-wide level.
- Operates within a hierarchy of governance structures (or tiers) with their own disciplines and processes. (e.g. Corporate Governance, Portfolio Governance, Project Governance)
- May exist at multiple geographic levels with the enterprise.

## Governance Repository

The governance artifacts are stored in the Architecture Repository

|Reference Data|Process Status|Audit Information|
|---|---|---|
|- Description of the governance procedures|- State of the governance processes|- Completed governance process action|
|- Guidance & Instruction in project implementation|- Examples: Compliance Requests, Dispensation Requests, Compliance Assessments|- Key decisions & responsible actors for any architecture project|
| | |- Architecture and supporting process developments, guidance and precedence|

## Benefits
The benefits of Architecture Governance are adopted from Corporate Governance.

### Discipline
Commitment to adhere to procedures, processes and authority structures
### Responsibility
Each contracted party is aware of their responsibilities
### Accountability
Each contracted party, organisation group or individual are accountable and authorised for their actions and the results of their actions
### Fairness

### Transparency
Decisions and supporting actions are available for inspection and review
### Independence
Processes and decision-making mechanisms will not be subject to undue influence and conflict of interest.
