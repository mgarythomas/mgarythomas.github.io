## Key Components

This is the key categorisation for the Architecture Content that is produced.

It structures the artifacts and work products to be developed and described in an Architecture.

There is a relationship between the content framework and the ADM phases.

There are multiple different frameworks for describing architecture content - TOGAF, Zachman, DoDAF and NAF, to name a few.
