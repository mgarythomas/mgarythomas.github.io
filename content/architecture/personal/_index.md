## What is an Architect?

I have thought about this so many times, but never really answered it to my. You read job applications and they seem to vary significantly in what is considered to be an architect. 
Often the definition is prexifed by a discriminator - Software, Solution, System, Enterprise, Integration, Network or Infrastructure. Admittedly, I think the last two are the most specific in detail.

What it does emphasize is that there are many types of architects, each with their own unique responsibilities and focus operating at different levels of abstraction and specialization. I think that [Gregor Hohpe](https://www.gregoryhohpe.com/) has a great [article](https://www.gregoryhohpe.com/2019/01/21/what-is-an-architect/) on this topic. In his book The Software Architecture Elevator he also defines what an architect is not:

- Senior Engineer
- People Manager
- Project Manager
- Firefighter and Troubleshooter

All of these have some validity as most architects will have had one or more of the above roles and understanding the details of engineering challenges and the project scheduling and management demands of a large implementation have some input and overlap with the architect. But, they should not be the primary focus of an architect's role.

I think the best way to define an architect is by their role and responsibilities. An architect is responsible for the overall design and structure of a system or solution. They are responsible for ensuring that the system or solution is designed in a way that is scalable, maintainable, and secure. They are also responsible for ensuring that the system or solution is designed in a way that is cost-effective and meets the needs of the organization.
