# Overview

Building on the simplified view of a [methodology](/architecture/methodology) the following is a simplified view of how the different steps come together.

I should point out that this was developed alongside a previous co-worker and is an attempt to show the general flow of steps. It also displays the fact that a number of the steps happen in parallel.

Critically, the development of a target architecture is based on having collected artifacts and defined the baseline for business, application and technology.

## Parallel

With a team working on an architecture it is often possible to work on different tasks in parallel. As TOGAF also indicated the processes of defining the Business Capabilities and capturing current application and data states may well happen in parallel.

Critically all of these process happen prior to the development of the Target State.

## Cycles

Developing a target architecture is rarely done in a single session.

It requires multiple iterations, options analysis, trade-offs and ideation sessions.
