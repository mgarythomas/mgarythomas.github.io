# Overview

TOGAF defines levels of architecture within an Architecture Landscape:
- Strategic
- Segment
- Capability

For simplicity, Business capabilities can exist at different levels as well. Even when we are dealing with architecture at a Strategic level we would expect that to encompass business capabilities at a broader level.

# Enterprise Architecture Transformation: A Structured Approach

In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, organisations require a systematic methodology to align technology initiatives with strategic objectives. The comprehensive framework depicted in our architectural transformation roadmap provides a disciplined approach to this challenge.

## The Six Phases of Architectural Transformation

### 1. Strategy Definition
**Capture & Define Business & Technology Strategy for each capability**

The journey begins by clearly articulating business goals and technical requirements. This foundational phase establishes the vision that will drive all subsequent activities, including the identification of business objectives, architectural principles, and requirements that will guide the transformation.

### 2. Current State Analysis
**Define the Current State aligned to the business capabilities**

Establishing a baseline understanding of the existing architecture is crucial. This phase involves documenting the 'Before' state, creating a comprehensive inventory of business processes, data structures, applications, and technology assets that form your current operational environment.

### 3. Target State Design
**Options Analysis to identify opportunities and enhancements**

With a clear view of 'where we are', the focus shifts to defining 'where we want to be'. This phase identifies opportunities and solutions that bridge the gap between current and future states, leveraging gap analysis to pinpoint areas requiring transformation.

### 4. Roadmap Development
**Elaborate the transition states for migration from Current State to Target**

The roadmap phase outlines the journey from current to target state, defining the sequence of transition architectures needed to realise the strategic vision. This includes creating detailed migration plans that chart the path forward.

### 5. Enablement
**Refine and complete the artefacts that will enable delivery of the vision**

This critical phase focuses on implementation governance and standards development. It includes establishing patterns, guardrails, and decision frameworks that will guide the execution of the architectural vision, ensuring consistency and quality across all initiatives.

### 6. Execution
**Use the architecture artefacts to deliver on the strategic vision**

The final phase involves putting the architecture into action, managing architectural change through a disciplined approach to design, modelling, building, and delivery. This includes reference architectures, solution building blocks, and operational models that collectively enable strategic outcomes.

## Key Components of the Framework

“The framework integrates key architectural domains and deliverables across all phases—business, information systems (data and application), technology, and operating model—underpinned by principles, requirements, and security considerations. Governance elements like patterns, guardrails, and decisions ensure consistency from design through delivery.”
- **Business Architecture**: Goals, objectives, and requirements
- **Information Systems Architecture**: Data and application components
- **Technology Architecture**: Technical infrastructure and security
- **Operating Model**: Governance structures and implementation approaches

By following this structured approach, organisations can ensure alignment between business strategy and technological implementation, reducing risk and maximising the value of transformation initiatives.

*This methodology adapts TOGAF principles into a streamlined framework that delivers practical, business-focused results whilst maintaining architectural rigour.*
