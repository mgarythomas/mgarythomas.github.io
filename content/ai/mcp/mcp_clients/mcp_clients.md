## Introduction

MCP Clients are crucial components that act as the bridge between AI applications (Hosts) and external capabilities provided by MCP Servers. Think of the Host as your main application (like an AI assistant or IDE) and the Client as a specialized module within that Host responsible for handling MCP communications.

### User Interface Client

Let’s start by exploring the user interface clients that are available for the MCP.

#### Chat Interface Clients

Anthropic’s Claude Desktop stands as one of the most prominent MCP Clients, providing integration with various MCP Servers.

#### Interactive Development Clients

Cursor’s MCP Client implementation enables AI-powered coding assistance through direct integration with code editing capabilities. It supports multiple MCP Server connections and provides real-time tool invocation during coding, making it a powerful tool for developers.

Continue.dev is another example of an interactive development client that supports MCP and connects to an MCP server from VS Code.

### Configuring MCP Clients

Now that we’ve covered the core of the MCP protocol, let’s look at how to configure your MCP servers and clients.

Effective deployment of MCP servers and clients requires proper configuration.

#### MCP Configuration Files

MCP hosts use configuration files to manage server connections. These files define which servers are available and how to connect to them.

The configuration files are very simple, easy to understand, and consistent across major MCP hosts.

The following is an example of an MCP configuration file for stdio transport:

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "File Explorer",
      "transport": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "python",
        "args": ["/path/to/file_explorer_server.py"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Environment Variables in Configuration Files

MCP hosts can also use environment variables in configuration files to make it easier to manage server connections. These values can be passed to the server using the `env` field.

The following is a 'python' example of an MCP configuration file using environment variables:

```python
import os

# Access environment variables
github_token = os.environ.get("GITHUB_TOKEN")
if not github_token:
    raise ValueError("GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable is required")

# Use the token in your server code
def make_github_request():
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {github_token}"}
    # ... rest of your code
```
