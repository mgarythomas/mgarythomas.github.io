## Introduction

###MCP SDK

The Model Context Protocol provides official SDKs for both JavaScript, Python and other languages. This makes it easy to implement MCP clients and servers in your applications. These SDKs handle the low-level protocol details, allowing you to focus on building your applicationâ€™s capabilities.

### SDK Overview

Both SDKs provide similar core functionality, following the MCP protocol specification we discussed earlier. They handle:

* Protocol-level communication
* Capability registration and discovery
* Message serialization/deserialization
* Connection management
* Error handling

## Implementation

The curated versions of the MCP SDK are managed [here](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol).
