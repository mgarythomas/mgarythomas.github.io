I am attempting to keep a track on all of the different tools that I have been playing with as I am still looking for the right tool - I would like to use just one, but I am not sure that will happen.

I can definitely say, that having worked a lot more with Windsurf recently I am finding that is currently the go to environment. Also, the integration with ChatGPT is proving to be very effective.

One thing is clear having now attempting to use Agentic Coding (I am struggling with the term Vibe Coding, but I will get over it!), is that they are very capable when used correctly and will definitely provide an engineer with a productivity boost.

## Tools

This list is not exhaustive, but it contains a list of things I started looking at in a very non-structured way. 

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Windsurf | Another VS Code fork similar to Cusor but different implementation, this seems to be getting a lot of traction as well as investment from OpenAI |
| [Firebase Studio](https://studio.firebase.google.com/) | Browser based offering from google. Has language support and integration with Gemini |
| Claude Code | A bit different in that it is a terminal based tool that is still in beta but provides a lot of functionality already. Can understand context based on your existing codebase. |
| Bolt.new | Figma tool that has a lot of support for design. A focus on building web and mobile applications directly in the browser. It runs on StackBlitzâ€™s WebContainers, allowing developers to build full-stack applications without installing any software. |
| Cursor | VS Code fork with a lot of support for coding and AI integration - I switched to Windsurf having started with Cursor.|
|v0 by Vercel | Seems to do a lot with the Vercel/Next.js framework. Converts natural language prompts into fully functional React components. It helps developers create UI components quickly using frameworks like Tailwind CSS. This tool enables rapid prototyping, making designing and iterating on user interfaces easier without writing extensive code. Also integrates with Figma |
| GitHub | Probably the first tool I used and it has come quite a long way quickly, like a lot of the competition. It is good in that it helps/forces me to keep all the code in one place. Doesn't have the same design/UI tools and focus |
| Lovable | Good for non-technical, but maybe not for everyone who likes to see the code. I haven't looked at this yet, maybe because I have focussed more on the coding type apps |
| Replit | A browser based tool that I haven't used in anger. Something to look into, but it looks quite cool |
| Creatr | Another AI no-code platform not sure what its distinguishing features are and I haven't used it |
| Cody | AI assistant that can integrate into multiple different IDEs |
| Tempo | Another AI powered tool with a focus on creating React apps |
 [n8n](https://n8n.io/) | AI workflow Automation |

## Product Design

Similar but different tools that assist in creating the product UX flow
| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| uizard | A tool that allows you to create a product UX flow using natural language prompts. Part of the Miro product family |
| galileo.ai| Another design tool that can create designs by prompting or the upload or images |
