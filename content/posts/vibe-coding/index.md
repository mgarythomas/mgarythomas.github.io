I am attempting to keep a track on all of the different tools that I have been playing with as I am still looking for the right tool - I would like to use just one, but I am not sure that will happen.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Bolt.new | Figma tool that has a lot of support for design. A focus on building web and mobile applications directly in the browser. It runs on StackBlitzâ€™s WebContainers, allowing developers to build full-stack applications without installing any software. |
| Cursor | VS Code fork with a lot of support for coding and AI integration|
| Windsurf | Another VS Code fork similar to Cusor but different implementation |
|v0 by Vercel | Seems to do a lot with the Vercel/Next.js framework. Converts natural language prompts into fully functional React components. It helps developers create UI components quickly using frameworks like Tailwind CSS. This tool enables rapid prototyping, making designing and iterating on user interfaces easier without writing extensive code. Also integrates with Figma |
| GitHub | Probably the first tool I used and it has come quite a long way quickly, like a lot of the competition. It is good in that it helps/forces me to keep all the code in one place. Doesn't have the same design/UI tools and focus |
| Lovable | Good for non-technical, but maybe not for everyone who likes to see the code. I haven't looked at this yet, maybe because I have focussed more on the coding type apps |
| Replit | A browser based tool that I haven't used in anger. Something to look into, but it looks quite cool |
| Creatr | Another AI no-code platform not sure what its distinguishing features are and I haven't used it |
| Cody | AI assistant that can integrate into multiple different IDEs |
| Tempo | Another AI powered tool with a focus on creating React apps |
 [n8n](https://n8n.io/) | AI workflow Automation |

## Product Design

Similar but different tools that assist in creating the product UX flow
| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| uizard | A tool that allows you to create a product UX flow using natural language prompts. Part of the Miro product family |
| galileo.ai| Another design tool that can create designs by prompting or the upload or images |
