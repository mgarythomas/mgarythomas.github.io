I have been reading a lot about how we developed stories as a means of communicating and how they are used in the so many different aspects of our lives.

Some of this is quite philosophical in describing the objective, subjective realities of the world but also the intersubjective reality of virtual things we create. Critical to this is the idea of a story as a means of communicating across a large scale human network.

Stories are critical to describing the intersubjective reality which seems to me to be very applicable to the world of architecture and how it needs to be described to large numbers of individuals to ensure the co-operation to implement an architecture to meet the goals and requirements of those involved.

Stories moved from being a solely verbal communication to something that was written down, when things are written they take on a much more fixed format as they can't just mutate in the next verbalisation. For an architecture story to change we want to record the changes (versioning and even some approval or governance process), but we also may need to adapt the story in presentation to align with the audience and the context of the story.

Why is this important? Because a narrative and story is critical to explain how a target state architecture will develop and also practically how does it meet the goals and requirements? What does the journey begin to look like (transition steps and roadmap)? what will we need to do? There is an obvious parallel here with one of the earliest stories the Odyssey which is attributed to Homer, but in reality, he likely drew on earlier verbal traditions. But that story does follow a journey of a hero, and the journey of a hero is a common theme in many stories. A roadmap is the journey for an architecture - we could probably extend some clumsy metaphors here about the clashing rocks (psylla and charybdis) or the siren calls of microservices...

Where it entails changes in behaviour, commitment (time and resources), new skills to be learnt and applied, the story helps to explain why this is important to all stakeholders and participants.

A word of warning, when we tell stories about architecture we want to move more to the objective and less the subjective (non-fiction rather than fiction). Though when we are talking about a future state it is an unreality at the time of the narrative, but the discussion is focussed on what is required to make it a reality.

When we are talking about future state rather than current state then we need to control artistic license and think about the measureable and defineable benefits.
