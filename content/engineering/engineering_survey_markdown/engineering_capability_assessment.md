# Dev Team Capability & Maturity Assessment

## Instructions
This survey assesses your development team's capabilities across technical, process, and cultural dimensions based on the DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) framework. Please answer honestly based on your current state, not aspirational goals.

**Rating Scale:**
- **1 - Not Implemented**: We don't do this at all
- **2 - Ad Hoc**: We do this inconsistently or only in some cases  
- **3 - Developing**: We do this regularly but it's not fully mature
- **4 - Mature**: We do this consistently with good practices
- **5 - Optimizing**: We do this excellently and continuously improve
