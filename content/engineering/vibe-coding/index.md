I am attempting to keep a track on all of the different tools that I have been playing with as I am still looking for the right tool - I would like to use just one, but I am not sure that will happen. Maybe MCP will help me with this.

I can definitely say, that having worked a lot more with Windsurf recently I am finding that is currently the go to environment. Also, the integration with ChatGPT is proving to be very effective.

“Vibe coding” is a growing practice where you lean into letting a coding agent do most of the heavy lifting while you focus on the architecture and features of your application. But effective vibe coding isn’t just about one-shot prompting, accepting all recommendations, and hoping for the best. It involves structuring your work, refining your prompts, and using frameworks that lead to cleaner, more efficient code.

“Vibe coding,” coined by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy in February, describes giving AI prompts to write code. As Karpathy puts it, developers can “fully give in to the vibes” and “forget the code even exists.”

I am struggling with the term Vibe Coding, but I will get over it!

```markdown
An update on this which I think brings this point home comes from Andrew Ng, he said that the term Vibe Coding misleads people into thing that the engineer just "go with the vibes" or flow.
“It’s unfortunate that’s called vibe coding,” Ng said at a firechat chat in May at conference LangChain Interrupt. “It’s misleading a lot of people into thinking, just go with the vibes, you know — accept this, reject that.”
Coding with AI is "a deeply intellectual exercise". He is otherwise very positive about the advances in coding with AI.
```

One thing is clear having now attempted to use Agentic Coding is that the tools are very capable and advancing very quickly, and when used correctly and will definitely provide an engineer with a productivity boost.


## Tools

This list is not exhaustive, but it contains a list of things I started looking at in a very non-structured way. 

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Windsurf | Another VS Code fork similar to Cusor but different implementation, this seems to be getting a lot of traction as well as investment from OpenAI |
| [Firebase Studio](https://studio.firebase.google.com/) | Browser based offering from google. Has language support and integration with Gemini |
| Claude Code | A bit different in that it is a terminal based tool that is still in beta but provides a lot of functionality already. Can understand context based on your existing codebase. |
| Bolt.new | Figma tool that has a lot of support for design. A focus on building web and mobile applications directly in the browser. It runs on StackBlitz’s WebContainers, allowing developers to build full-stack applications without installing any software. |
| Cursor | VS Code fork with a lot of support for coding and AI integration - I switched to Windsurf having started with Cursor.|
|v0 by Vercel | Seems to do a lot with the Vercel/Next.js framework. Converts natural language prompts into fully functional React components. It helps developers create UI components quickly using frameworks like Tailwind CSS. This tool enables rapid prototyping, making designing and iterating on user interfaces easier without writing extensive code. Also integrates with Figma |
| GitHub Copilot | Probably the first tool I used and it has come quite a long way quickly, like a lot of the competition. It is good in that it helps/forces me to keep all the code in one place. Doesn't have the same design/UI tools and focus |
| Lovable | Good for non-technical, but maybe not for everyone who likes to see the code. I haven't looked at this yet, maybe because I have focussed more on the coding type apps |
| Replit | A browser based tool that I haven't used in anger. Something to look into, but it looks quite cool |
| Creatr | Another AI no-code platform not sure what its distinguishing features are and I haven't used it |
| Cody | AI assistant that can integrate into multiple different IDEs |
| Tempo | Another AI powered tool with a focus on creating React apps |
 [n8n](https://n8n.io/) | AI workflow Automation |

## Product Design

Similar but different tools that assist in creating the product UX flow
| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| uizard | A tool that allows you to create a product UX flow using natural language prompts. Part of the Miro product family |
| galileo.ai| Another design tool that can create designs by prompting or the upload or images |

I haven't really looked into this section yet.
