This is a blog site for content created during research.

The site itself is developed using Hugo,but deploys as a static website.

I started the content as a place to make notes as I was doing some research. So some of the markdown files I created date back quite a while.
What I have subsequently done is to try and structure the content in a way that is more accessible to others and also create a standalone blog site using Hugo.
